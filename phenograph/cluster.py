        and its transpose

        If False, use a Gaussian kernel.
    :param primary_metric: Distance metric to define nearest neighbors.
        Options include: {'euclidean', 'manhattan', 'correlation', 'cosine'}
        Note that performance will be slower for correlation and cosine.

    :param louvain_time_limit: Maximum number of seconds to run modularity optimization. If exceeded
        the best result so far is returned
    :param nn_method: Whether to use brute force or kdtree for nearest neighbor search. For very large high-dimensional
        data sets, brute force (with parallel computation) performs faster than kdtree.
    :param seed: Set seed for stochastic Louvain method, so the results can be replicated

    :return graph: numpy sparse array of the graph that was used for clustering
